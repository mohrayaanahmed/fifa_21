Procuring young talent in FIFA 21 by using Machine Learning to optimally scout players in the FIFA 21 Manager Mode

The project delves in the intricate attributes of all FIFA players by identifying which attributes define a position and which of them are imperative that make a footballer shine above the rest. The project aims in tackling this and procuring the players that have the potential to be the very best and making sure they reach it. 

To know the ranked order of attributes for a position, multiple linear regression is used to predict the overall of the players in one particular position. Having an accuracy rate better than any other models, it was ideal to choose attributes after being trained and tested by regression.

Each position has its own ipynb file, and the positions (after grouping) are:

1. Goalkeeper
2. Centre-back
3. Full-back
4. Defensive Midfielder
5. Centre Midfielder
6. Central Attacking Midfielder
7. Winger/Wide Midfielder
8. Striker

The final result is in a .png file, 'Attributes_for_all_positions'. It includes a table consisting of the most important attributes for each position. Therefore, when procuring a young talent on FIFA 21 without scouting, one can simply identify if a player will be potentially great or not by looking at their attribute stats. Furthermore, they can train them on specic attributes to ensure that the player reaches their dynamic potential.
