Procuring young talent in FIFA 21 by using Machine Learning to optimally scout players in the FIFA 21 Manager Mode

The project delves in the intricate attributes of all FIFA players by identifying which attributes define a position and which of them are imperative that make a footballer shine above the rest. The project aims in tackling this and procuring the players that have the potential to be the very best and making sure they reach it. 

To know the ranked order of attributes for a position, multiple linear regression is used to predict the overall of the players in one particular position. Having an accuracy rate better than any other models, it was ideal to choose attributes after being trained and tested by regression.
